Other notes or comments to the grader:

The definition of farm_report is ambiguous, it is not so clear. So there are multiple choice you could choose. I choose two I think most reasonable options.

Any special, build, or data instructions: Data structure that meet the requirement of the assignment would meet needs of this program. 
To use the command line input, start it with: 
java -jar executable.jar <File/path>
java -jar executable.jar -d <Directory/path>

To use command line model, 
java -jar executable.jar -c
java -jar executable.jar <Any character>

Bug report: Everything should be handled.

Future work section: Maybe more bug test, functionality is fine.
