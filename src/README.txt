Other notes or comments to the grader:

There are still some part not good for user experience, this will be changed in the future. 

There are a lot of screenshots. Because of the requirement of "repeat step 5 to show what your application can do", this program do need to create those screenshots. And there might be even more as different operation would have different result and will create different GUI. 

Some parts are still in construction...
