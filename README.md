# Milk-Weight-Project

Might add some in the future. 
Currently, this is a project for CS400. Data source and project requirement is done by professor [Deb Deppeler](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~deppeler/). They would save the copyright for the idea and the big picture for this project. 

The design and implementation is mostly done by me.
